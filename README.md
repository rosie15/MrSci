# Targets
Sci papers are probably the most important thing for researchers and phd students, how many and how good the paper you published decides things like whether you can get promoted or, how good is your bonous.
However, our Nanjing University only provide a .xls file containing 10000+ journals, which is to hard for researchers to use. 
Therefore, I decided to write this project aiming to make it easier to check out how good a journal is in the criteria made by Nanjing University.
